# Challenge 31

> [Back](../../../README.md)

## Challenge Summary

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

I created a function called (tree_intersection)

Big-O :
for time: o(n), because we used a for-loop twice overall
for space: o(n), because the size of the list will vary according to the input string

## Solution

```
